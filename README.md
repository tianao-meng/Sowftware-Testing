# Sowftware-Testing

In this project, i am responsible for finding the top three grammatical constructs which slow down Z3 and CVC4 solver.
Given the output of the z3 and cvc4 smt solvers on int and real theories, I find relation between the number of occurence of constructs in each formula and the running time. Then do statical analysis using pearson correlation to calculate Correlation coefficientï¼›then pick the highest three constructs.
